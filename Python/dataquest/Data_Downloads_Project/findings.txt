Based on our exploratory analysis, of students in juvenile detention centers, the overwhelming majority are male, whereas in magnet schools, the gender balance is much closer to 50%


We also see that the gender and race breakdown is different than overall demographics. Whites & Hispanics  make up ~73% of the US population, and only about 50% here


The breakdown by gender is also suprising, males are over-indexed to about 55% here, whereas the gender ratio in the US is ~50/50
